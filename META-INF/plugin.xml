    <id>JumpToUsage</id>
    <description><![CDATA[
        Simple plugin to make navigation to element usages easier than using Alt+F7.<br>
        Works similar to Ctrl+Alt+F7 in Resharper.<br>
        Why this plugin?! Well, I browse code more often than I write.. So I for one definitely needed this.. Hope it's useful for others too..<br><br>

        And this's the first plugin in a series of plugins planned to make navigation and code analysis a whole lot easier.. (provided I manage to work on them :D )<br><br>
        
        Default key binding is to Alt+Shift+F7, coz in Linux Ctrl+Alt+F7 is taken up for switching to virtual console 7
        (which typically is the one running your current X session).<br><br>

        Comes with no configuration page. If you want something to be configurable, let me know and it'll be added.<br>
        Bouquets and Brickbats are welcome :)

    <change-notes><![CDATA[
        1.8 - Few more improvements..
            <ul>
                <li> Plugin gives feedback with a Progress Bar while searching..
                <li> No more frozen UI due to long searches
                <li> Usage search can be cancelled
            </ul>
              <br><br>

        1.6 - Minor usability improvements..
            <ul>
              <li> Fixed NPE when the action is invoked on non editor windows.. Ex, on the Project manager
              <li> Editor brings usage to focus when you navigate to usage..
              <li> Popup shows up just below the cursor.. So the element on which the action was invoked is visibile..
              <li> Duplicate references are filtered out..
              <li> Action runs in a separate thread, so it doesn't freeze the UI if it takes long to finish..
            </ul>
              <br><br>

        1.4 - Corrupted jar in previous version..
              Still doesn't work with 5.x
              <br><br>

        1.3 - Announcing that the plugin is not compatible with 5.x OpenAPI..
            Works with 6.0 Beta (Build #5581) onwards..
            Will be coming up with a proper version soon.. <br><br>

        1.2 - First stable release
             <ul>
                <li> Fix to bug: Anonymous classes appear with a name 'null' on the list
                <li> Improved List Rendering: Now you get nice icons on the list :)
                <li> Well, what more? Waiting for bug reports/feature requests :D
             </ul>
             <br>
        1.0 - Beta release<br>
        Few minor refactorings to the code structure<br><br>
        0.1 - Initial pre beta release.<br>
