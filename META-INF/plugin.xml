    <description><![CDATA[
        Simple plugin to make navigation to element usages easier than using Alt+F7.<br>
        Works similar to Ctrl+Alt+F7 in Resharper.<br>
        Why this plugin?! Well, I browse code more often than I write.. So I for one definitely needed this.. Hope it's useful for others too..<br><br>

        And this's the first plugin in a series of plugins planned to make navigation and code analysis a whole lot easier.. (provided I manage to work on them :D )<br><br>
        
        Default key binding is to Alt+Shift+F7, coz in Linux Ctrl+Alt+F7 is taken up for switching to virtual console 7
        (which typically is the one running your current X session).<br><br>

        Comes with no configuration page. If you want something to be configurable, let me know and it'll be added.<br>
        Bouquets and Brickbats are welcome :)<br>
