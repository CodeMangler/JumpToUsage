    <description><![CDATA[
        Simple plugin to make navigation to element usages easier than using Alt+F7.<br>
        Works similar to Ctrl+Alt+F7 in Resharper.<br>
        Why this plugin?! Well, I browse code more often than I write.. So I for one definitely needed this.. Hope it's useful for others too..<br><br>

        And this's the first plugin in a series of plugins planned to make navigation and code analysis a whole lot easier.. (provided I manage to work on them :D )<br><br>
        
        Default key binding is to Alt+Shift+F7, coz in Linux Ctrl+Alt+F7 is taken up for switching to virtual console 7
        (which typically is the one running your current X session).<br><br>

        Comes with no configuration page. If you want something to be configurable, let me know and it'll be added.<br>
        Bouquets and Brickbats are welcome :)<br><br>

        <b>UPDATE (11th November, 2010):</b><br>
            Since version 7, IntelliJ IDEA comes with it's own implementation of this feature. Therefore, this plugin is obsolete, and will not be developed further. <br>

        2.0 - Final Vesion.
            <p>
                IntelliJ comes bundled with it's own implementation of this feature since IDEA v7, which can be invoked with Ctrl + Alt + F7.
                Therefore, this plugin will no longer be developed/maintained. <br>
                The plugin sources are available at Sourceforge (SVN):https://jumptousage.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jumptousage and GitHub: https://github.com/CodeMangler/JumpToUsage.git
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incorporated the fix provided by <a href="http://plugins.intellij.net/space/?lg=thhart">Thomas Hartwig</a> to make the plugin work with IDEA 8.x</li>
                <li>Updated the plugin.xml limiting the plugin to IDEA 8.1.x. The plugin will not work with any previous or future versions of IDEA anymore.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            
        1.9 - Bugfix - Plugin does not work properly with GUI code views (like with CodeDependency)
            <ul>
                <li> Thanks to <a href="http://intellij.net/forums/profile.jspa?userID=1237">Mikael Karlsson</a> for reporting the bug and providing a fix :)
            </ul>
            <br><br>
        
        1.8 - Few more improvements..
            <ul>
                <li> Plugin gives feedback with a Progress Bar while searching..
                <li> No more frozen UI due to long searches
                <li> Usage search can be cancelled
            </ul>
              <br><br>

        1.6 - Minor usability improvements..
            <ul>
              <li> Fixed NPE when the action is invoked on non editor windows.. Ex, on the Project manager
              <li> Editor brings usage to focus when you navigate to usage..
              <li> Popup shows up just below the cursor.. So the element on which the action was invoked is visibile..
              <li> Duplicate references are filtered out..
              <li> Action runs in a separate thread, so it doesn't freeze the UI if it takes long to finish..
            </ul>
              <br><br>

        1.4 - Corrupted jar in previous version..
              Still doesn't work with 5.x
              <br><br>

        1.3 - Announcing that the plugin is not compatible with 5.x OpenAPI..
            Works only with 6.0 Beta (Build #5581) onwards..
            Will be coming up with a proper version soon.. <br><br>

        1.2 - First stable release
             <ul>
                <li> Fix to bug: Anonymous classes appear with a name 'null' on the list
                <li> Improved List Rendering: Now you get nice icons on the list :)
                <li> Well, what more? Waiting for bug reports/feature requests :D
             </ul>
             <br>
        1.0 - Beta release<br>
        Few minor refactorings to the code structure<br><br>
        0.1 - Initial pre beta release.<br>
