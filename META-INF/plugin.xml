  <description>
      Simple plugin to make navigation to element usages easier than using Alt+F7.
      Works similar to Ctrl+Alt+F7 in Resharper.
      Default key binding is to Alt+Shift+F7 since in Linux, Ctrl+Alt+F7 is taken up for switching to virtual console 7
        (typically the one running your current X session).

      Comes with no configuration page. If you want something to be configurable, let me know and it'll be added.
      Bouquets and Brickbats are welcome :)
